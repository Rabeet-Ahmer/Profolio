# Profolio: Animation-Heavy Portfolio Website

This is a production-ready, animation-heavy portfolio website built with modern web technologies.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js (App Router)**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Shadcn/UI**
- **Framer Motion**
- **GSAP + ScrollTrigger**
- **Lenis smooth scrolling**

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Next.js App Router structure:

- `app/`: Contains the main application logic, including layouts and pages.
- `components/`: Contains all the React components, organized by feature.
- `hooks/`: Contains custom React hooks.
- `lib/`: Contains utility functions and libraries.
- `styles/`: Contains global styles.

## Animations

This project uses a combination of Framer Motion and GSAP for animations:

- **Framer Motion:** Used for component-level animations, entrance/exit animations, and complex UI interactions.
- **GSAP + ScrollTrigger:** Used for scroll-based animations, parallax effects, and complex timelines.
- **Lenis:** Used for smooth scrolling, which enhances the overall user experience.

All animation logic is designed to be performant and reusable.
